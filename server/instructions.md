### Step by step instructions to build

- [] Create server directory
- [] from server directory
- [] run `yarn init`
- [] yarn add express
- [] touch app.js
- [] `yarn add eslint --dev`
- [] `./node_modules/.bin/eslint --init`
- [] touch .gitignore
- [] ignore /node_modules
- [] npm i nodemon --save-dev
- [] in app.js create express instance and serve on port
- [] `npm install graphql express-graphql`
- [] in app.js create graphqlHTTP instance
- [] add middle-ware create endpoint for request to be handed to the graphql instance (as a function which accepts the schema object) and graphiql: true
- [] touch schema/schema.js
